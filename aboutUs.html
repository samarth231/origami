            This entire website is about animals, but if you click on the picture of the animal it will<br>
            teach you how to make an origami model of the animal. Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper into decorative shapes and figures.<br>
            Origami helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and mental concentration. Use of the hands directly stimulates areas of the brain.<br>
